# 🌏 Airpure Innovation – AQI Market Fit Analysis

This project was developed for **Airpure Innovation**, a fictional company aiming to enter the air purifier market.  
The analysis leverages **Air Quality Index (AQI)** data to identify high-priority markets, assess seasonal patterns, and evaluate product opportunities.

## 📊 Project Overview
**Objective:**  
Conduct both primary and secondary AQI analysis to determine market fit for air purifier products and identify top target cities.

**Scope Includes:**
- Tracking AQI trends post-2022
- Identifying most polluted regions and high-risk populations
- Analyzing weekend vs. weekday AQI patterns
- Correlating AQI with health statistics and policy measures
- Mapping competitor features and pricing gaps

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (DAX, Power Query)
- **Excel** (Data cleaning & transformation)
- **Python** (if applicable – Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Public AQI datasets and government health data

## 📈 Key Insights
- Seasonal AQI spikes in northern cities during winter
- Cities with high PM2.5 levels overlap with respiratory disease hotspots
- Weekend AQI improvements in certain metros suggest traffic-linked pollution
- Competitor analysis reveals unmet demand for **low-noise, smart-connected purifiers**
