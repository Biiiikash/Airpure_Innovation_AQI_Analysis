# 🌏 Airpure Innovation – AQI Market Fit Analysis

This project was developed for **Airpure Innovation**, a fictional company aiming to enter the air purifier market.  
The analysis leverages **Air Quality Index (AQI)** data to identify high-priority markets, assess seasonal patterns, and evaluate product opportunities.  
The project was completed as part of **Codebasics Resume Project Challenge #20**.

## 📊 Project Overview
**Objective:**  
Conduct both primary and secondary AQI analysis to determine market fit for air purifier products and identify top target cities.

**Scope Includes:**
- Tracking AQI trends post-2022
- Identifying most polluted regions and high-risk populations
- Analyzing weekend vs. weekday AQI patterns
- Correlating AQI with health statistics and policy measures
- Mapping competitor features and pricing gaps

**Data Sources:**
- **Primary Data:** Provided AQI datasets from Codebasics.io Resume Project Challenge #20  
- **Secondary Data:** Independently researched and collected by me from publicly available government, health, and market reports.  
  *(This data was not part of the original dataset and was added to enhance analysis depth and accuracy.)*

## 📈 Key Insights
- Delhi has the highest average AQI in India, with PM2.5 as the top pollutant (24.76% contribution), followed by PM10, O₃, and NO₂.
- Winter months in northern states show the worst AQI levels, while some metros record slight weekend improvements due to reduced traffic.
- Air pollution is linked to 227K health cases and 1,245 deaths, with children (1–5 yrs) and elderly (60+) being the most affected groups.
- EV adoption is highest in Kerala, with Maharashtra leading in total EV registrations, but penetration remains below 2% nationwide.
- The Indian air purifier market, valued at ₹44B (2024–25), is projected to reach ₹156B by 2033 (14.06% CAGR), with major opportunities in the ₹8K–₹20K price range and IoT-enabled models.
